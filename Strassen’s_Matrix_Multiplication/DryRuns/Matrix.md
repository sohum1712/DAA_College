# 🚀 Strassen Matrix Multiplication Algorithm

Strassen's Matrix Multiplication is a **divide and conquer** algorithm that is faster than the conventional matrix multiplication algorithm. Instead of performing 8 multiplications, it only performs **7**, reducing the time complexity from **O(n³)** to approximately **O(n^2.81)**.

## 📌 What’s Inside?

```bash
Strassen/
├── StrassenMultiplication.cpp  # 💻 C++ code with detailed comments
└── StrassenExplanation.md      # 📚 Step-by-step breakdown of the logic


🔍 Why Strassen?
Conventional Matrix Multiplication takes:

T(n) = O(n³)

Strassen reduces it to:

T(n) = O(n^log₂7) ≈ O(n^2.81)

This makes a significant difference for large matrices in real-world applications like:

Image Processing

Computer Graphics

Scientific Computing

🚦 How It Works
Strassen breaks two n x n matrices into 4 submatrices and computes 7 products (instead of 8) using recursive multiplication and matrix addition/subtraction.

Main Steps:

Divide each matrix into 4 sub-matrices.

Recursively calculate the 7 products (M1 to M7).

Combine these to get the result matrix.

🧠 Pre-requisite Knowledge
To fully understand the code and logic, you should know:

Matrix operations (Addition, Subtraction)

Recursion

Divide and Conquer strategy

Even if you're a beginner, we’ve added 📘 StrassenExplanation.md to make it crystal clear!
