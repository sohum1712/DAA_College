# 📚 DAA_College – Design and Analysis of Algorithms

Welcome to my structured repository for **Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA)**. This project contains C++ code implementations and visual dry runs for common algorithms including searching, sorting, and more. It is a part of my college learning and practice journey. 👨‍💻

## 🔍 Algorithms Implemented

### 📘 Searching Algorithms

| Algorithm       | Code File | Dry Run |
|----------------|-----------|---------|
| 🔹 Linear Search | [`LinearSearch.cpp`](./Searching/LinearSearch.cpp) | [`LinearSearch.md`](./dryrun/LinearSearch.md) |
| 🔹 Binary Search | [`BinarySearch.cpp`](./Searching/BinarySearch.cpp) | [`BinarySearch.md`](./dryrun/BinarySearch.md) |

## 🧠 Visual Dry Runs

Understanding the logic is crucial! That's why I've added **detailed dry runs** with visuals like:

| Linear Search Dry Run | Binary Search Dry Run |

📎 Find them under [`dryrun/`](./dryrun)
